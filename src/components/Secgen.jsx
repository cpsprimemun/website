With great honour and pride, I welcome all of you to the third edition of Chennai Public School’s Prime Model United Nation. As the Secretary General of this edition, I assure you that CPS PRIME MUN is the perfect place to hone your skills in formal debate and to make connections that last a lifetime. Participating in MUNs is not only about the awards or the recognition you get but also about the experience and exposure you gain. Our well equipped Executive Board members have faced all the trials and tribulations of being a delegate as they stand on the other side of the table to judge you. An event of such a large scale would also aid you in socialising with others, as you begin to open your mind to all the perspectives that other delegates hold, by coming together to solve issues that plague our society. 

 With over 10 committees encompassing varying geopolitical and national issues, CPS PRIME MUN stands at the foreground in connecting you to the world. As a delegate in the conference, you’ll be a part of one of Chennai’s Biggest MUNs with debate of utmost quality and its very own Socials.

 I kindly request all of you to register yourself for CPS PRIME MUN’24 happening on July 19th and 20th. I’m looking forward to your esteemed presence to grace our event. Don’t hesitate to reach out to us anytime for assistance. 

 Thank you
